# Fake DSA Membership List Generator
A python module to randomly generate a membership list in the style of DSA National for use in testing DSA tech tools.

## Getting Started
To run this code, you'll need to have Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 installed on your machine. [Windows installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners).
You'll also need to clone this repository into a folder on your computer.
Once you have done this, you need to install the required packages by running the following commands from inside the project folder:

1. Create a virtual environment named `.venv`:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the new virtual envronment `.venv`:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required Python modules
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features
* Creates a fake membership list containing sharable data for use in testing DSA tech tools.
* Can create lists with "real" / mappable addresses within the geographic boundary of the specified chapter.

## Usage
1. Open the repository folder you downloaded earlier in a terminal and run the command:
```shell
python -m generate_fake_list [--args]
```
2. The output files will be located in the repository directory and has the default name `fake_membership_list.csv` and `fake_membership_list.zip`.
